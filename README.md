### Installing

If you want to read the [R Markdown file](https://github.com/necantis/InnovationBlockChained/blob/master/abm_simulator.Rmd), you might want to use R Studio

## Running the tests

The current tests are comparing different hypotheses:

### H0: An idea challenge with one single winner will outperform a combination of chainstorming and cheatstorming

[] Create a simple idea challenge and assess the value of the idea and the ideas to assess to choose the one retained.
[] Create another idea challenge and assess the value of the sum of ideas and the number of ideas to assess to choose the ones retained.

## Built With (Main R libraries)

* lpSolve to choose the ideas to pool
* tidyverse to work with Tidy data
